[x] Fix attacking action (now only equips weapon)
[x] Implement 1 continuous action for aiming the attacks
[x] Add logging when rewards are given (new addition and total for each agent)
[x] Maybe add reward for being closer to opponent in order for them to learn that they have to fight, and then remove it once they have a basic control of the game.
[ ] Retrain SwordAgent with fixed aiming? If so, rebuild sword_env
