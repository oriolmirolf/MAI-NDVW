Only by defeating all three can you shatter the barrier and return home.\n\nThe first layer of your prison appears peaceful - a quiet forest bathed in golden light. But this beauty is a lie. Thornback, the Guardian of Growth, has twisted nature itself into a weapon. The trees whisper warnings. The creatures serve him. To proceed deeper into the realm and find your way home, Thornback must fall."
