## Image Requirements

- **Format:** PNG preferred (good quality, transparent backgrounds if needed)
- **Resolution:** At least 1920x1080 for in-game screenshots
- **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 or similar works well for slides and report
- **Naming:** Exactly as specified above (case-sensitive on some systems)

## Tips for Taking Screenshots

1. **Hide UI:** Press F11 or whatever key hides the Unity game UI for cleaner shots
2. **Zoom level:** Use a zoom level that shows the feature clearly but gives context
3. **Lighting:** Make sure the room is well-lit (unless it's the Night theme!)
4. **Timing:** Take screenshots when enemies/decorations are visible to show population
5. **Diversity:** Try to show variety in each theme (different obstacles, decorations, etc.)

## After Adding Screenshots

Once you've added all the screenshots, the LaTeX will automatically include them in both:
- `Reports/Sprint3/main.tex` (compiled report)
- `Reports/Sprint3/slides.tex` (presentation slides)

Just recompile the LaTeX documents to see the images appear!
