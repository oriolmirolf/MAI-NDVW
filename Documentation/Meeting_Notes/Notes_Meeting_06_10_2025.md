# First meeting NDVW 
Date: 06/10/2025
Atendees: All (Dani, Jean, Bruno, Oriol)

## Points discussed

Style:
- 2D; 3D is a pain to use
- Procedurally Generated; part of the "AI" of the videogame
- Roguelike?
  - What's new:
    - AI-generated content!
- Penalty?
  - Health-bar
  - Re-start when death
- Bosses:
  - 3 bosses
  - auto-generate dungeon for each boss (different colours?)
  - save point after boss defeat
  - story and dungeon-state generated from scratch from last save-point (boss-defeat)
    - so if you defeat boss 1 and die trying to kill boss 2 you go back to dungeon and story of end of boss 1
- Upgrades? (still-to-discuss)
  - Coins
  - Shop
  - Perma-upgrades
  - Items?
  - Upgrades to stats? (easier)
  
Story:
- LLM generated??
  - How to guardrails?
    - LLM generates 4 responses; you must choose one

Steps:
- Graphical Assets
  - Generate, too?
  - Asset store in Unity
  - What we find should steer what kind of story we make
- Start off a tutorial? 

Report:
- We should include some stuff from the class in the report: https://campusvirtual.ub.edu/pluginfile.php/9762889/mod_resource/content/1/Behavior_Selection_Algorithms.pdf
- Also include Roadmap in the Report

Inspiration:
