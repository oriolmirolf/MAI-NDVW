# Feedback from Sprint 2

- Include Appendix with per-person tasks
	- No need to retroactively do it for Sprints 1 and 2
- Simplify story: Complex to follow (overkill for the scope of the project)
	- Explain the checkpoint system next to the story
- Explicitly mention in the text that the FSM is not the main goal of the project (which is the reason why it is so simple)
- Add more reasoning to our choices (why do we use each of the algorithms/techniques that we do?)
- PCG (Uri and Dani's) part is missing a figure or a high-level pseudo-code explaining the pipeline of the steps through which the content is generated (and then explain each of the parts mentioned there)
- Improve visual style of GenAI networking diagram [basically she doesn't like ASCII art :(]
	- Also explain a bit deeper the steps of the pipeline
- RL:
    - More formal description of reward function 
    - Experiment results
- Final document should have 23-25 pages

Additional notes in printed version of Sprint 2 (Bruno has it)
